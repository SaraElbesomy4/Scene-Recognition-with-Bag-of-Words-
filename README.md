# Scene-Recognition-with-Bag-of-Words-
We will perform scene recognition with three different methods. We will classify scenes into one of 15 categories by training and testing on the 15 scene database (Lazebnik et al. 2006).
the implementation is with three scene recognition schemes:

●	Tiny images representation (get_tiny_images()) and nearest neighbor classifier (nearest_neighbor_classify()).

●	Bag of words representation (build_vocabulary(), get_bags_of_words()) and nearest neighbor classifier.

●	Bag of words representation and linear SVM classifier (svm_classify()).
